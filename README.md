This project combines upstream projects of engineblock and virtualdataset into one main project. More details on release practices and contributor guidelines are on the way.

# Status

This is in active development. Collaborators are welcome. However, there is still work to be done to groom the slope for new users.

## nosqlbench

This project aims to provide a missing power tool in the test tooling arsenal.

The design goals:

1. Provide a useful and intuitive Reusable Machine Pattern for constructing and reasoning about concurrent performance tests. To encourage this, the runtime machinery is based on [simple and tangible core concepts](http://docs.nosqlbench.io/user-guide/concepts/).
2. Reduce testing time of complex scenarios with many variables. This is achieved by controlling tests from an [open javascript sandbox](http://docs.nosqlbench.io/user-guide/scripting/). This makes more sophisticated scenarios possible when needed.
3. Minimize the amount of effort required to get empirical results from a test cycle. For this, [metrics reporting](http://docs.nosqlbench.io/user-guide/metrics/) is baked in.

In short, Engine Block wishes to be a programmable power tool for performance
testing. However, it is somewhat generic. It doesn't know directly about a
particular type of system, or protocol. It simply provides a suitable machine
harness in which to put your drivers and testing logic. If you know how to build
a client for a particular kind of system, EB will let you load it like a plugin
and control it dynamically.

The most direct way to do this, if you are a tool developer, is to build your
own activity type drivers and embed EB as the core runtime. You can always
experiment with it and learn how it works by using the built-in diagnostic
drivers.

## History

The Engine Block project started as a branch of [test
client](http://github.com/jshook/testclient). It has since evolved to be more
generic.
